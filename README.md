Hello ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif)

My name is Martha Bennett (she/her)


I am a freshly-hatched Developer.

### About

I'm learning to code with School of Code! It's been a whirlwind few months and I've loved meeting other developers and trying something new. 

After studying Acting at the Oxford School of Drama, I read Education with English and Drama at the University of Cambridge (BA, MA Cantab) and worked as a Teaching Assistant for children with Autism in a primary school. 

In 2017, I began tutoring and took on a role as a governess for a musician on her world tour. It was the funds from this trip that helped me launch my own education business, Ludo Tutors. 

We provide children around the world with access to experienced tutors, LAMDA (Drama and Public Speaking) Exams and tuition via our AI-enabled platform. This business has been running for nearly 6 years and we have over 150 wonderful tutors on our books. We have partnered with education providers such as Twinkl, children's charities such as Winston's Wish and educational organisations in many countries. As the business is now fairly self-sufficient, I'm looking for a new challenge and to join a friendly team.

It was through developing a Moodle platform and the website for our clients (which needed to work in both China and the rest of the world - no small task!), that I met and enjoyed working with a lot of developers. I got curious about their jobs and so started to look into coding courses. A friend recommended I apply for the School of Code and the rest is history!
